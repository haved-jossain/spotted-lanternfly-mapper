The Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) is considered an invasive species identified in Pennsylvania in September 2014. If left unchecked, the spotted lanternfly can potentially wreak havoc on the grape, orchard and logging industries across United States. Spotted Lanternfly Mapper is an ArcGIS Pro tool that can extract locations of Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) spread and sightings from recent social media posts and generate maps based on the date and location of the SLF sightings. This tool can be used for collecting data about the current extent of SLF spread from various online media sources which can then be used in modeling its spread.
